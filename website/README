I implemented the ability to adjust the font size. So that when the user activated the perspective
buttons on the side navigation the font will increase or decrease accordingly. Additionally, I 
made it so that the font can't get too small, so it stops after a certain size, because then the 
user wouldn't even be able to read the font. 

Additionally, all buttons are reachable with tabbing. The button the user is out is outlined with 
a blue boxed outline to better user experience. The button you are on can then be pressed and accessed
with the return key. 

Finally, the images in the news and research pages are rather small so I made it so that the images 
are enlarged 1.5x the original size so its easier for the user to see. I used the onmouse and offmouse
functions in javascript to achieve this.
